# Tasker

## About this app
    Tasker is a task and time management app designed to allow users to create and share lists of tasks which need to be completed. It allows users to assign priority to a task, and a status to each task so that other users can be aware of a tasks importance or if a task has been started or completed by someone else. It uses authorization to connect lists of tasks to the user who created them allowing that user to share their lists. Another feature is that a user can assign a 'read ony' or 'edit' status the a user with whom they have shared a list, allowing or preventing others from manipulating a checklist based on the creators needs.
